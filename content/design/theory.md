# Theory

Code and Documentation are one thing

- Documentation _explains_ the code

- Code _does_ what the documentation says


It is _difficult_ (impossible?) to write code of any magnitude without some degree documentation
  - The names of things 
  - The structure of the program
  - tests

Most (all?) commonly used languages have facilities comments

Comments are the defacto standard 'documentation language' in use.

The problem is that comments are _unstructured_ and so cannot provide _rigorous_ documentation

The difference between 'unstructured' and 'structured' is only a parser away.

# Answer

Give programmers the _freedom_ to produce not only an executable but other 'content' with their source code.

Programmers write and express themselves in code _as they wish!_

Allow the developer to write parsers for their own unique style of 'unstructured documentation language' (aka code comments, etc...) for the code that is being written _at the moment_

Give the developer a concrete _target_ to translate _their_ source into an _intermediate format_ that is rich enough to pull information from to generate _many_ views of documentation suitable for different purposes.

Give content-tool creators a solid and stable _source_ (the common format) that can be used to generate content (documentation, etc...) from.
