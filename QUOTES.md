> I’m confident that we will be able to expect
each member of the next generation of programmers to
be familiar with a document language as well as a programming language, as part of their basic education.

  - Why did this not happen?

> Now that I am writing all my programs in WEB, an
unforeseen problem has, however, arisen: I suddenly
have a collection of programs that seem quite beautiful
in my own eyes, and I have a compelling urge to publish
all of them so that everybody can admire these works of
art. A nice little 10-page program can easily be written
and debugged in an afternoon and evening; if I keep
accumulating such gems, I’ll soon run out of storage
space, and my office will be encrusted with webs of my
own making. There is no telling what will happen if
lots of other people catch WEB fever and start foisting
their creations on each other. I can already envision the
appearance of a new journal, to be entitled Webs, for
the publication of literate programs; I imagine that it
will have a large backlog and a large group of dedicated
editors and referees.
